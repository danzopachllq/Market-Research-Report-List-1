<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ECCO₂R Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Vein-Venous Mode (V-V)"</li><li>"Arterial-Venous Pattern (A-V)"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>ECCO₂R (Extracorporeal Carbon Dioxide Removal) market can be segmented into two primary types: **Vein-Venous Mode (V-V)** and **Arterial-Venous Pattern (A-V)**. In the V-V mode, blood is drawn from a vein, processed to remove carbon dioxide, and returned to the same venous system, primarily targeting respiratory support. In contrast, the A-V pattern involves extracting blood from an artery, removing carbon dioxide, and returning it to a vein, enhancing oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination, often used in more critical cases.</p></p>
