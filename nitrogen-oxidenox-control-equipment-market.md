<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitrogen Oxide(NOx) Control Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LNB</li><li>SCR</li><li>SNCR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) control equipment market primarily includes three types: Low NOx Burners (LNB), Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), and Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR). LNB technology reduces NOx emissions during combustion by optimizing fuel-air mixing. SCR utilizes a catalyst and a reducing agent, typically ammonia, to convert NOx into nitrogen and water at high temperatures. SNCR, on the other hand, injects a reducing agent at lower temperatures for NOx reduction, offering a simpler, more cost-effective solution. Each technology serves specific industrial emission reduction needs.</p></p>
